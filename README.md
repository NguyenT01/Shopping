# Sample .NET Core API project with Microservices
This is a sample .NET Core project that I have been working on during my self-study periodüòä.

It implements a simple backend for managing an online store (e-commerce).There are 4 main attributes: **Customer, Product, Order and Price**.

At the moment, there are 3 branches in this project. Each branch has its own features and also uses typical situation.
- **[mainüåø](https://github.com/NguyenT01/Shopping)**: It is the main branch. It only focus on how a microservice communicates with .NET Core API.
- **[redisüü•](https://github.com/NguyenT01/Shopping/tree/redis)**: This branch focuses on how to use and store cache data in Redis and how to apply it in .NET Core API.
- **docker-deployment** *(You are here ‚¨ÜÔ∏è)*: This branch focuses on how to deploy this project in Docker.

## Which technologies or libraries did I use for this project? üîç
I will list in chronological order the things I have done starting from when I began this project.

- .NET Core 8.0
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server 2022
- MediatR
- gRPC
- **Docker**
- **Consul by HashiCorp**
